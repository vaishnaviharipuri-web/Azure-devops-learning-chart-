This quick reference will help you choose from one of the 4 work process templates
that determine how teams interact with the building blocks of work within the Azure DevOps
framework:
Basic
Choose Basic when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to
track work. Note: Basic is currently in a selective Preview for new users of Azure Boards only.
Agile
Choose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks
development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user
stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.
Scrum
Choose Scrum when your team practices Scrum. This process works great if you want to track
product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board, or break PBIs and bugs down
into tasks on the taskboard.
CMMI
Choose CMMI when your team follows more formal project methods that require a
framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process,
you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.
CMMI process supports formal change management activities. Tasks support tracking
Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.
